Hi. Bye. Hi. After the pull, it did the === thing which is a rebase, which I had to skip to be able to push again.
<<<<<<< HEAD
So if I copy to github, it counts as coming from a different branch and I have to pulldown and skip rebasing before I add more code and push with git.

So this update can't be pushed, until I pull down, rebase, retype it, and push.
